# Project Summary

This project focuses on the development of a novel hardware system and software algorithm for radiotherapy, with the goal of advancing radiotherapy techniques and exploring new technological possibilities.

## Hardware System:

A three-dimensional biological ex vivo motion simulation device (3D-BioLungEx) was designed to simulate human lung respiration. The 3D-BioLungEx comprises the following modules:

- **Monitoring Module**: Responsible for real-time monitoring of the motion status of biological samples.
- **Simulation Module**: Simulates human lung respiration based on monitoring data.

Both the monitoring and simulation modules have publicly available source codes.

## Software Algorithm:

The project also developed the IOSI-BLDose, a novel algorithm based on iterative optimization and scatter inversion, to calculate the three-dimensional dose distribution within biological tissue during radiotherapy. This algorithm is designed to enhance the precision and effectiveness of radiotherapy treatments.

The source code for this algorithm is also publicly available.
